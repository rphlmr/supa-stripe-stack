  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Remix & Stripe Stack, backed by Supabase (driven by Prisma), that integrates authentication, subscriptions (multi-currency, month and year intervals) and handling tier limit.

  Remix deploy target: Fly.io

  <b>Disclaimer</b>: This stack gives you a good starting point but it can't handle a specific business model. You'll need to adapt it to your needs and you must understand how Stripe works before going to production.

> I want to thank and credit [DevXO](https://github.com/dev-xo) for its work on [Stripe Stack](https://github.com/dev-xo/stripe-stack) which helped me a lot to build the webhook part of this stack.

## Why Supabase?

I love it.

# Requirements

## #1 Supabase project

-   Create a [Supabase database](https://supabase.com/) (the free tier gives you 2 databases)

    > It'll ask you to define the `Database Password`. Save it somewhere, you'll need it later.

    ![create_project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20722140/216093400-405916ae-7c30-4aa1-8c73-b41a512f1507.png)

-   Go to https://app.supabase.io/project/{PROJECT}/settings/database to find your database secrets

    ![database_secrets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20722140/216097216-f77a56ac-b17e-4031-bd29-ad239639829d.png)

    -   It's time to copy/paste some secrets from this page 👆 into your `.env` file
    -   `URI` 👉 `DATABASE_URL`
        -   Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your `Database Password` (from the previous step)

-   Go to https://app.supabase.io/project/{PROJECT}/settings/api to find your API secrets

    ![project_secrets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20722140/216094297-df265aaf-1c50-4dc7-bdd0-14bc8aa00e17.png)

    -   It's time to copy/paste some secrets from this page 👆 into your `.env` file
    -   `URL` 👉 `SUPABASE_URL`
    -   `anon` `public` 👉 `SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC`
    -   `service_role` `secret` 👉 `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`

## #2 Stripe project

> You'll also need to install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to test the webhook locally

> This CLI gives you the ability to listen Stripe webhook events and forward them to your local server.

-   Create a [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
-   Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

    ![stripe_secrets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20722140/216101036-1e94b7fe-29e6-4f34-85eb-9e0f7c0002a4.png)

    -   It's time to copy/paste some secrets from this page 👆 into your `.env` file
    -   `Secret key` 👉 `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

-   As long as you're here, and let's assume you've installed the Stripe CLI, you can run the following command to start Stripe webhook listener and get your `webhook signing secret`
    ```sh
    stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
    ...
    > Ready! You are using Stripe API Version [2022-11-15]. Your webhook signing secret is whsec_d7f96cbdb268xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
    -   `whsec_d7f96cbdb268xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` 👉 `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET`

## #3 Fly project

TODO
In the meantime, you can look at [my other stack working with Fly](https://github.com/rphlmr/supa-fly-stack/blob/main/README.md#deployment)

## #4 Environment variables

There are other environment variables you can set in your `.env` file.

-   `SERVER_URL`: the URL of your server (`http://localhost:3000` in local env)
-   `SESSION_SECRET`: a secret string used to encrypt your session cookie
-   `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`: default currency for your Stripe subscriptions if the user currency is not supported. (only used for UI purposes)
    > **Note**:
    >
    > The currency we show on the Pricing page is based on the user locale.See [getDefaultCurrency](app/utils/http.server.ts)
    >
    > It's not reliable because Stripe checkout will choose a currency based on the user's IP address.
    >
    > You can implement a better solution by using geo-ip services.
    >
    > **After the user subscribe, we'll use the currency selected by Stripe**.

# How it works

TODO: explain the stack

TODO: explain the pricing plan

TODO: explain how to make this stack your own

# Development

It's time to play with the stack 🎉

> ⚠️ This step only applies if you've opted out of having the Remix CLI install dependencies for you:
>
> ```sh
> npx remix init
> ```

The default pricing plan included in this stack can be found in [`scripts/config/index.ts`](scripts/config/index.ts)

## Seed the database and Stripe

```sh
npm run setup
```

## Start Stripe Webhook listener

**It is mandatory to test the webhook locally.**

Stripe sends webhook events to your server when a customer subscribes, cancels, or updates their subscription.

Stripe events are sent to the [`/api/webhook`](app/routes/api/webhook.ts) endpoint.

```sh
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

## Start the server

With the Stripe webhook listener running, open a new terminal and use the command to start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Both the listener and the development server must be running concurrently in separate terminals for the app to work.
